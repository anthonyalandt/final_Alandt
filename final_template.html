			<p>Crime rates are something first-term Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb said he wanted to curb. A main point of issue during last year's mayoral election, Bibb immediately wanted to overhaul the way police interacted with citizens in order to prevent a further rise in crime.</p>

			<p>Recent data from <a href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Cleveland-Ohio.html" target="_blank">city-data.com</a> collected about the city of Cleveland, Ohio, demonstrated a general rise in crime between the years of 2006 and 2019. The data, broken down into eight categories (murders, rapes, robberies, assaults, burglaries, thefts, auto thefts and arson), visualizes where Cleveland stands in comparison to the rest of the state of Ohio.</p>

			<p> The following findings will break down the state of crime ‚Äî and how different crimes rose and fell ‚Äî in Cleveland during the time of the data set:</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3> Comparatively High Crime Rates </h3>
			<p>One of the ways the database compares data is by signaling how each particular crime ranks in the state of Ohio. Overall, crimes rates in the city are much higher than the rest of the state, specifically arson, auto thefts, burglaries, assaults, robberies, rapes and murders.</p>

			<p>This has caused officials around the city to reach out to various other organizations for help, including the Case Western Reserve University police to patrol areas around campus and the city.</p>

			<p>"In a perfect world, we would have enough officers to be the first responders even in these jurisdictions that Case and University Circle covers," Cleveland Police Director Karrie Howard said in a statement.</p>

			<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üö® The deadline to apply for the new Community Police Commission is tonight at 11:59 p.m. Don‚Äôt miss your chance, apply now: <a href="https://t.co/DD70vPVlIf">https://t.co/DD70vPVlIf</a> <a href="https://t.co/iy4z7ytbcS">pic.twitter.com/iy4z7ytbcS</a></p>&mdash; City of Cleveland (@CityofCleveland) <a href="https://twitter.com/CityofCleveland/status/1523701338877571072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

			<p>In nearly all of the years, the crime index value per 100,000 of each crime, adjusted for the number of visitors and daily workers commuting into cities, ranked "much bigger" than the state average. Only thefts ranked as "bigger" than the state average, which it did each year of the data set.</p>

			<p>The consistent trend of crime in Cleveland ranking much higher than the rest of the state has hurt housing costs in the area, and local politicians fear that it could hinder further expansion of business for a city on an otherwise upward trajectory.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3> Overall Increase in Crime </h3>
			<p>Over the life of the data set, crime generally increased in the city of Cleveland, despite numerous concerted efforts from city officials and law enforcement to crack down on crime. While some years, such as 2011, demonstrated an uncharacteristic spike in crime, with others, such as 2009, showing a decrease in crime, the overall trend line depicts a rise in overall crime during the former 14 years.</p>

			<p>In 2021, the increase of particularly violent crimes ‚Äî homicides, shootings and felony assaults ‚Äî became national news. Many law enforcement leaders, including Dean of the City Council Mike Polensek, <a href="https://www.cleveland19.com/2021/01/04/clevelands-rise-violent-crime-makes-national-headlines-city-leaders-react/"target="_blank">said</a> the issue is broader than just one aspect of policing or the city.</p>

			<p>‚ÄúYes, we do need more police officers, we do need better-trained police officers, we need officers who are doing 21st century policing, we need police officers who are technologically savvy, but we can‚Äôt just blame society‚Äôs problems on the police,‚Äù Griffin said.</p>

			<h3> Decrease in Some Crimes </h3>
			<p>In general, more violent crimes became more prevelant in Cleveland over the course of the data set. However, smaller crimes that home owners and those looking to start a family might pay more attention to such as  arson, auto thefts, burglaries, robberies and thefts generally decreased over the course of the data set.</p>

			<p>Specifically, the number of auto thefts and burglaries drastically decreased from 2006 to 2019, demonstrating a safer community policing effort that Cleveland and Mayor Bibb want to achieve.</p>

			<p>Mayor Bibb's push for a community-centered approach to policing could help continue this downward trend of daily crimes. If successful, housing markets within the city could jump to levels the city has not seen in decades.</p>

			<iframe title="Decreasing auto thefts and burglaries" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-BPN0U" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BPN0U/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="10"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

			<p>Cleveland stands at an interesting cross roads, one that demonstrates it is doing a better job curbing crimes that might affect home owners on a day-to-day basis. However, the rise in violent or life-altering crimes chides from the mayor's mission of a safe city ripe for blossoming industry.</p>

			<p>With the overall data demonstrating that ‚Äî in terms of crime rates ‚Äî Cleveland is still one of the most dangerous cities in the state of Ohio, countless efforts have been made by legislators to fix these issues. A new levy passed in 2021 created the Cleveland Community Police Commission, whose <a href="https://clecpc.org/"target="_blank">goal</a> is "provide community input on police policies to help strengthen relationships between officers and the communities they serve."</p>

			<p>While former Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson continuously made strides to curb the city's rise in crime, such as introducing a policy that outlawed excessive force, each mayoral election and debate he was involved in centered around crime. Already, the CPC has releaased an annual report for 2021 and police sureillance technology recommendations.</p>

			<p>Bibb said the work to end Cleveland's rise in crime, especially violent crimes on the east side of the city, does not end with just one commission or one act of legislation.</p>
